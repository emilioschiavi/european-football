## European Football

This is a small Android app that shows results and rankings of most european football championships.
The following API is used: http://api.football-data.org.

## Status

For the time being only getting the list of available competitions.
There are also no styles now, not yet, only texts. I want to provide functionality first, then adjust the UI.

## Motivation

Learning new Android techniques by coding something funny.

## Contributors

At the moment there are no contributors beside myself.
