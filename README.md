## European Football

This is a small Android app that shows results and rankings of most european football championships.
The following API is used: http://api.football-data.org.

## Status

For the time being only getting the list of available competitions and some basic competition data.
The UI is far from being perfect...styles shall be added.
Ranking list added -> fixed some bug...
Not all competitions provide the ranking list in the same format, for example the Champions League.
In this case nothing is shown, just an error message.
Added flags to the teams in the ranking list.

## Some Screenshots
